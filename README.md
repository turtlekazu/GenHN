Generative UI Hacker News Client. An experimental project that dynamically generates visual DNA to reconstruct the Hacker News interface. Comes with preset themes inspired by distinctive product design systems. Add a Gemini API key to generate any theme on the fly, or paste CSS generated by an external AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) using the built-in template prompt to instantly switch the visual style.

## Features

- **12 Design Presets**: Instantly switch between design systems inspired by iconic brand aesthetics.
- **AI Theme Generation**: Enter a Gemini API key to generate entirely new design themes from any free-text prompt.
- **Paste CSS**: Paste any CSS theme generated by an external AI tool and apply it instantly. Applied themes can be saved as custom presets.
- **AI Prompt Template**: A built-in, ready-to-copy prompt for generating themes with ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini without an API key.
- **Feed Navigation**: Switch between Hacker News feeds — Top, New, Ask, Show, and Jobs.
- **Live HN Data**: Fetches real stories from the Hacker News Firebase API (30 stories per page, with infinite scroll via "More").
- **No Build Step**: Pure vanilla JS + CSS. Open `index.html` directly in a browser.
- **View Transitions**: Smooth page transitions using the View Transition API (with graceful fallback).

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click a preset button in the bottom-right panel to apply a built-in theme.
3. Use the header navigation links to switch between HN feeds (Top / New / Ask / Show / Jobs).

## Architecture

The entire application lives in two files:

- **`index.html`** — Static DOM structure (header, story list, control panel).
- **`gardener.js`** (~1,300 lines) — All application logic:
  - `SYSTEM_STYLE` — Base CSS (layout, glassmorphism, responsive design).
  - `STYLE_PRESETS` — Theme definitions via CSS custom properties.
  - `HNData` — Hacker News API integration (feed fetching, pagination).
  - `App` — Main controller (theming, rendering, event handling, localStorage persistence).

## AI Theme Generation (Gemini API)

GenHN can generate new themes on-the-fly using the [Gemini API](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).

1. Obtain a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
2. Open the control panel (bottom-right) and expand the **Generate (Gemini API)** section.
3. Paste your key and click **Save Key** — it is stored only in your browser's localStorage and never sent anywhere other than the Gemini API.
4. Type any design description in the prompt field (e.g. `"brutalist newspaper"`, `"cozy dark cafe"`) and click **Apply**.

The app calls `gemini-2.5-flash` to produce a complete CSS theme from your prompt, which is then applied immediately without a page reload.

## Paste CSS (External AI Workflow)

No API key? Use any AI tool to generate a theme and paste the CSS directly:

1. Open the **AI Prompt Template** section in the control panel and click **Copy Prompt**.
2. Paste the prompt into ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or any other AI tool, replacing the bracketed line with your theme idea.
3. Copy the CSS the AI returns.
4. Open the **Paste CSS** section in the control panel, paste the CSS, and click **Apply**.
5. Optionally, click **Save as Preset** to store the theme as a custom preset button for quick reuse.

## Adding a New Theme Manually

Add an entry to `STYLE_PRESETS` in `gardener.js` following the existing pattern. Each theme overrides CSS custom properties (and optionally adds component-specific rules).
